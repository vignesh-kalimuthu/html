 But <sup>the one trip</sup> that has stayed in my mind and <sub>had the greatest impact on me wasn’t a family trip.</sub></i>

<p style="border:3px solid Tomato;">It was my synagogue’s youth group trip to Cincinnati.
Every year my temple youth group takes all it’s freshmen on a special trip to Cincinnati, as part of their confirmation in the Jewish faith.
 <ins>We all got up early on a Friday and the bus departed at seven. After an exhaustingly long bus ride it was time for our first destination.</ins>
We all got dressed up in our good clothes and arrived at a church.</p>

<del>Actually it wasn’t a church. It was the first reformed Jewish temple ever established in the world.</del> 
The founders wanted to create a place of worship that was seemingly identical to the norm (Christianity.) 
<mark>The temple had an Ottoman-esque interior, roofed with elaborately painted domes, lined with traditional wooden pews,</mark>
with a massive organ in the back that’s pipes snaked up the wall like ivy.
 There was even a steeple (back when the temple was first built, the neighboring church made their steeple taller because they didn’t want to be outdone by jews.)
